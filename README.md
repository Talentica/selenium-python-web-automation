# selenium-python-web-automation

## Installation Steps
- **Step 0:** Ensure you have Python installed
In Linux or MacOS, Python is installed by default. 

If you are using Windows, you will need to download Python from the official download page - https://www.python.org/downloads/
To verify, Python has been installed, run the command: `python --version`



- **Step 1:** Setup a virtual environment

`python -m venv <path-to-your-virtual-environment>`



- **Step 2:** Install Selenium

`pip install â€“U selenium`



- **Step 3:** Install Browser Drivers

I am using Safari browser which has native support for WebDriver, meaning you don't have to install anything.

If you wish to use other browsers, you may need to download drivers for those. 

For example - for *Chrome* - download ChromeDriver from https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/. Make sure to download according to your browser version.
